The `namingconventions` linter ensures that field names adhere to a set of defined naming conventions.

By default, `namingconventions` is not enabled.

When enabled, it must be configured with at least one naming convention.

Naming conventions must have:
- A unique human-readable name.
- A human-readable message to be included in violation errors.
- A regular expression that will match text within the field name that violates the convention.
- A defined "operation". Allowed operations are "Inform", "Drop", "DropField", and "Replace".

The "Inform" operation will simply inform via a linter error when a field name violates the naming convention.
The "Drop" operation will suggest a fix that drops violating text from the field name.
The "DropField" operation will suggest a fix that removes the field in it's entirety.
The "Replace" operation will suggest a fix that replaces the violating text in the field name with a defined replacement value.

Some example configurations:

**Scenario:** Inform that any variations of the word 'fruit' in field names is not allowed
```yaml
linterConfig:

	namingconventions:
	  conventions:
	    - name: nofruit
	      violationMatcher: (?i)fruit
	      operation: Inform
	      message: fields should not contain any variation of the word 'fruit' in their names

```

**Scenario:** Drop any variations of the word 'fruit' in field names
```yaml
linterConfig:

	namingconventions:
	  conventions:
	    - name: nofruit
	      violationMatcher: (?i)fruit
	      operation: Drop
	      message: fields should not contain any variation of the word 'fruit' in their names

```

**Scenario:** Do not allow fields with any variations of the word 'fruit' in their name
```yaml
linterConfig:

	namingconventions:
	  conventions:
	    - name: nofruit
	      violationMatcher: (?i)fruit
	      operation: DropField
	      message: fields should not contain any variation of the word 'fruit' in their names

```

**Scenario:** Replace any variations of the word 'color' with 'colour' in field names
```yaml
linterConfig:

	namingconventions:
	  conventions:
	    - name: BritishEnglishColour
	      violationMatcher: (?i)color
	      operation: Replacement
	      replacement: colour
	      message: prefer 'colour' over 'color' when referring to colours in field names

```
