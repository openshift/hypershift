# HyperShift

HyperShift is a middleware for hosting [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) control
planes at a scale that solves for cost and time to provision, as well as portability
cross cloud with a strong separation of concerns between management and workloads.
Clusters are fully compliant [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform) (OCP)
clusters and are compatible with standard OCP and Kubernetes toolchains.
