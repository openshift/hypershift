          HostedCluster is the primary representation of a HyperShift cluster and encapsulates
          the control plane and common data plane configuration. Creating a HostedCluster
          results in a fully functional OpenShift control plane with no attached nodes.
          To support workloads (e.g. pods), a HostedCluster may have one or more associated
          NodePool resources.

                      for external registries. It allows cluster admins to configure which registries
                      OpenShift is allowed to import images from, extra CA trust bundles for external
                      registries, and policies to block or allow registry hostnames.
                      When exposing OpenShift's image registry to the public, this also lets cluster
                      admins specify the external hostname.

                          requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created  or updated routes
                          matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy.
                          Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route
                          annotation, and affect route admission.


                          A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation:
                          "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"
                          E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains


                          - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route
                          is rejected.
                          - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies
                          determines the route's admission status.
                          - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.


                          The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously
                          admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
                          However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.


                          Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

                          in the "openshift-config-managed" namespace. Clients that expect to make

                          the proxy, and may use the trusted-ca-bundle for non-proxy HTTPS requests as

                          defaultNodeSelector helps set the cluster-wide default node selector to
                          restrict pod placement to specific nodes. This is applied to the pods
                          created in all namespaces and creates an intersection with any existing
                          nodeSelectors already set on a pod, additionally constraining that pod's selector.
                          For example,
                          defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector
                          field in pod spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created
                          in all namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be
                          impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to
                          the namespace.
                          For example, if a new namespace is created with
                          node-selector='type=user-node,region=east',
                          the annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east
                          gets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector annotation
                          is set on the project the value is used in preference to the value we are setting
                          for defaultNodeSelector field.
                          For instance,
                          openshift.io/node-selector: "type=user-node,region=west" means
                          that the default of "type=user-node,region=east" set in defaultNodeSelector
                          would not be applied.

                          policy is a reference to a ConfigMap containing scheduler policy which has
                          user specified predicates and priorities. If this ConfigMap is not available
                          scheduler will default to use DefaultAlgorithmProvider.
                          The namespace for this configmap is openshift-config.

                          For the KubeVirt platform, the basedomain can be autogenerated using

                              one or more of the customRules.


                              The following profiles are provided:
                              - Default: default policy which means MetaData level logging with the exception of events
                                (not logged at all), oauthaccesstokens and oauthauthorizetokens (both logged at RequestBody
                                level).
                              - WriteRequestBodies: like 'Default', but logs request and response HTTP payloads for
                              write requests (create, update, patch).
                              - AllRequestBodies: like 'WriteRequestBodies', but also logs request and response
                              HTTP payloads for read requests (get, list).
                              - None: no requests are logged at all, not even oauthaccesstokens and oauthauthorizetokens.


                              Warning: It is not recommended to disable audit logging by using the `None` profile unless you
                              are fully aware of the risks of not logging data that can be beneficial when troubleshooting issues.
                              If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging
                              and reproduce the issue in order to troubleshoot properly.


                              If unset, the 'Default' profile is used as the default.

                          requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created  or updated routes
                          matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy.
                          Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route
                          annotation, and affect route admission.


                          A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation:
                          "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"
                          E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains


                          - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route
                          is rejected.
                          - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies
                          determines the route's admission status.
                          - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.


                          The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously
                          admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
                          However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.


                          Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

                          For example,
                          defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector
                          field in pod spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created
                          in all namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be
                          impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to
                          the namespace.
                          For example, if a new namespace is created with
                          node-selector='type=user-node,region=east',
                          the annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east
                          gets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector annotation
                          is set on the project the value is used in preference to the value we are setting
                          for defaultNodeSelector field.
                          For instance,
                          openshift.io/node-selector: "type=user-node,region=west" means
                          that the default of "type=user-node,region=east" set in defaultNodeSelector
                          would not be applied.

                                  successfully evaluated, the update will not be recommended.

                                    ClusterCondition is a union of typed cluster conditions.  The 'type'
                                    property determines which of the type-specific properties are relevant.
                                    When evaluated on a cluster, the condition may match, not match, or
                                    fail to evaluate.
