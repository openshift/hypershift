                  tuningConfig is a list of references to ConfigMaps containing serialized
                  Tuned or PerformanceProfile resources to define the tuning configuration to be applied to
                  nodes in the NodePool. The Tuned API is defined here:

                  https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator/blob/2c76314fb3cc8f12aef4a0dcd67ddc3677d5b54f/pkg/apis/tuned/v1/tuned_types.go

                  The PerformanceProfile API is defined here:
                  https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator/tree/b41042d42d4ba5bb2e99960248cf1d6ae4935018/pkg/apis/performanceprofile/v2

                  Each ConfigMap must have a single key named "tuning" whose value is the
                  JSON or YAML of a serialized Tuned or PerformanceProfile.
                  Changing this field will trigger a NodePool rollout.
