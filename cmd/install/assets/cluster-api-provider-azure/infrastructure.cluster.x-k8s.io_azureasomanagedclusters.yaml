                  ControlPlaneEndpoint is the location of the API server within the control plane. CAPZ manages this field
                  and it should not be set by the user. It fulfills Cluster API's cluster infrastructure provider contract.
                  Because this field is programmatically set by CAPZ after resource creation, we define it as +optional
                  in the API schema to permit resource admission.
