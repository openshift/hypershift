                  FailureDomains specifies the list of unique failure domains for the location/region of the cluster.
                  A FailureDomain maps to Availability Zone with an Azure Region (if the region support them). An
                  Availability Zone is a separate data center within a region and they can be used to ensure
                  the cluster is more resilient to failure.
                  See: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview
                  This list will be used by Cluster API to try and spread the machines across the failure domains.
