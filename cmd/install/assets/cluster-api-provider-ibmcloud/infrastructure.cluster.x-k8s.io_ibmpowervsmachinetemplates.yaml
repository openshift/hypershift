                          processors is the number of virtual processors in a virtual machine.
                          when the processorType is selected as Dedicated the processors value cannot be fractional.
                          maximum value for the Processors depends on the selected SystemType.
                          when SystemType is set to e880 or e980 maximum Processors value is 143.
                          when SystemType is set to s922 maximum Processors value is 15.
                          minimum value for Processors depends on the selected ProcessorType.
                          when ProcessorType is set as Shared or Capped, The minimum processors is 0.25.
                          when ProcessorType is set as Dedicated, The minimum processors is 1.

                          reasonable default, which is subject to change over time. The default is set based on the selected ProcessorType.
                          when ProcessorType selected as Dedicated, the default is set to 1.
                          when ProcessorType selected as Shared or Capped, the default is set to 0.25.
