                          maximum value for the Processors depends on the selected SystemType.
                          when SystemType is set to e880 or e980 maximum Processors value is 143.
                          when SystemType is set to s922 maximum Processors value is 15.
                          minimum value for Processors depends on the selected ProcessorType.
                          when ProcessorType is set as Shared or Capped, The minimum processors is 0.25.
                          when ProcessorType is set as Dedicated, The minimum processors is 1.
