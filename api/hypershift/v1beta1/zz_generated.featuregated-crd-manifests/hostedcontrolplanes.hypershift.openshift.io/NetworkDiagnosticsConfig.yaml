                              When this field is unset (i.e. when it is set to the empty string), identity is implied.
                              The behavior of unset can and will change over time.  Even if encryption is enabled by default,
                              the meaning of unset may change to a different encryption type based on changes in best practices.

                              When encryption is enabled, all sensitive resources shipped with the platform are encrypted.
                              This list of sensitive resources can and will change over time.  The current authoritative list is:

                          matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy.
                          Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route
                          annotation, and affect route admission.

                          A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation:
                          "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"
                          E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains

                          - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route
                          is rejected.
                          - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies
                          determines the route's admission status.
                          - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.

                          The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously
                          admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
                          However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.

                          Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

                                If domainPatterns is specified and a route is created with a spec.host matching one of the domains,
                                the route must specify the HSTS Policy components described in the matching RequiredHSTSPolicy.

                                The use of wildcards is allowed like this: *.foo.com matches everything under foo.com.
                                foo.com only matches foo.com, so to cover foo.com and everything under it, you must specify *both*.

                              used within this temporal window. The user will need to acquire a new

                              per client, then that value takes precedence. If the timeout value is
                              not specified and the client does not override the value, then tokens

                          The trustedCA field should only be consumed by a proxy validator. The

                          key "ca-bundle.crt", merging it with the system default trust bundle,
                          and writing the merged trust bundle to a ConfigMap named "trusted-ca-bundle"
                          in the "openshift-config-managed" namespace. Clients that expect to make
                          proxy connections must use the trusted-ca-bundle for all HTTPS requests to
                          the proxy, and may use the trusted-ca-bundle for non-proxy HTTPS requests as

                          defaultNodeSelector helps set the cluster-wide default node selector to
                          restrict pod placement to specific nodes. This is applied to the pods
                          created in all namespaces and creates an intersection with any existing
                          nodeSelectors already set on a pod, additionally constraining that pod's selector.
                          For example,
                          defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector
                          field in pod spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created
                          in all namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be
                          impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to
                          the namespace.
                          For example, if a new namespace is created with
                          node-selector='type=user-node,region=east',
                          the annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east
                          gets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector annotation
                          is set on the project the value is used in preference to the value we are setting
                          for defaultNodeSelector field.
                          For instance,
                          openshift.io/node-selector: "type=user-node,region=west" means
                          that the default of "type=user-node,region=east" set in defaultNodeSelector
                          would not be applied.

                            update targets.

                            completionTime, if set, is when the update was fully applied. The update
                            that is currently being applied will have a null completion time.
                            Completion time will always be set for entries that are not the current
                            update (usually to the started time of the next update).

                            indicates the update is not fully applied, while the Completed state
                            indicates the update was successfully rolled out at least once (all

                            before it was installed. If this is false the cluster may not be trusted.
                            Verified does not cover upgradeable checks that depend on the cluster
