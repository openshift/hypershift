          HostedCluster is the primary representation of a HyperShift cluster and encapsulates
          the control plane and common data plane configuration. Creating a HostedCluster
          results in a fully functional OpenShift control plane with no attached nodes.
          To support workloads (e.g. pods), a HostedCluster may have one or more associated
          NodePool resources.

                              profile specifies the name of the desired top-level audit profile to be applied to all requests
                              sent to any of the OpenShift-provided API servers in the cluster (kube-apiserver,
                              openshift-apiserver and oauth-apiserver), with the exception of those requests that match
                              one or more of the customRules.

                              The following profiles are provided:
                              - Default: default policy which means MetaData level logging with the exception of events
                                (not logged at all), oauthaccesstokens and oauthauthorizetokens (both logged at RequestBody
                                level).
                              - WriteRequestBodies: like 'Default', but logs request and response HTTP payloads for
                              write requests (create, update, patch).
                              - AllRequestBodies: like 'WriteRequestBodies', but also logs request and response
                              HTTP payloads for read requests (get, list).
                              - None: no requests are logged at all, not even oauthaccesstokens and oauthauthorizetokens.

                              Warning: It is not recommended to disable audit logging by using the `None` profile unless you
                              are fully aware of the risks of not logging data that can be beneficial when troubleshooting issues.
                              If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging
                              and reproduce the issue in order to troubleshoot properly.

                              If unset, the 'Default' profile is used as the default.

                          requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created  or updated routes
                          matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy.
                          Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route
                          annotation, and affect route admission.

                          A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation:
                          "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"
                          E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains

                          - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route
                          is rejected.
                          - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies
                          determines the route's admission status.
                          - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.

                          The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously
                          admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
                          However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.

                          Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

                  scheduler:
                    description: |-
                      scheduler holds cluster-wide config information to run the Kubernetes Scheduler
                      and influence its placement decisions. The canonical name for this config is `cluster`.
                    properties:
                      defaultNodeSelector:
                        description: |-
                          defaultNodeSelector helps set the cluster-wide default node selector to
                          restrict pod placement to specific nodes. This is applied to the pods
                          created in all namespaces and creates an intersection with any existing
                          nodeSelectors already set on a pod, additionally constraining that pod's selector.
                          For example,
                          defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector
                          field in pod spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created
                          in all namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be
                          impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to
                          the namespace.
                          For example, if a new namespace is created with
                          node-selector='type=user-node,region=east',
                          the annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east
                          gets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector annotation
                          is set on the project the value is used in preference to the value we are setting
                          for defaultNodeSelector field.
                          For instance,
                          openshift.io/node-selector: "type=user-node,region=west" means
                          that the default of "type=user-node,region=east" set in defaultNodeSelector
                          would not be applied.

                          mastersSchedulable allows masters nodes to be schedulable. When this flag is
                          turned on, all the master nodes in the cluster will be made schedulable,
                          so that workload pods can run on them. The default value for this field is false,
                          meaning none of the master nodes are schedulable.
                          Important Note: Once the workload pods start running on the master nodes,
                          extreme care must be taken to ensure that cluster-critical control plane components
                          are not impacted.

                  Version input for this field is free, no validation is performed against spec.release or maximum and minimum is performed.
                  If defined, it will dicate the version of the components running management side, while spec.release will dictate the version of the components landing in the hosted cluster data plane.
                  If not defined, spec.release is used for both.
                  Changing this field will trigger a rollout of the control plane.
                  The behavior of the rollout will be driven by the ControllerAvailabilityPolicy and InfrastructureAvailabilityPolicy for PDBs and maxUnavailable and surce policies.

                  The maximum and minimum supported release versions are determined by the running Hypersfhit Operator.
                  Attempting to use an unsupported version will result in the HostedCluster being degraded and the validateReleaseImage condition being false.
                  Attempting to use a release with a skew against a NodePool release bigger than N-2 for the y-stream will result in leaving the NodePool in an unsupported state.
                  Changing this field will trigger a rollout of the control plane components.

                                            promql is a PromQL query classifying clusters. This query
                                            query should return a 1 in the match case and a 0 in the
                                            does-not-match case. Queries which return no time
                                            series, or which return values besides 0 or 1, are
                                            evaluation failures.
