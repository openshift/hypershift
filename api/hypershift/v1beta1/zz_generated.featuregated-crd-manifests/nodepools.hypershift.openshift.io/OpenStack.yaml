                  After the timeout, any remaining attached volumes will be ignored and the removal of the machine will continue.

                              Configuring a DiskEncyptionSet allows greater control over the encryption of the VM OS disk at rest.
                              Can be used with either platform (Azure) managed, or customer managed encryption keys.

                          Size names should start with a Family name, which is represented by one of more capital letters, and then be followed by the CPU count.
                          This is followed by 0 or more additional features, represented by a, b, d, i, l, m, p, t, s, C, and NP, refer to the Azure documentation for an explanation of these features.

                          For example, "D32ads_v5" would be a suitable general purpose VM size, or "ND96_MI300X_v5" would represent a GPU accelerated VM.

                  tuningConfig is a list of references to ConfigMaps containing serialized
                  Tuned or PerformanceProfile resources to define the tuning configuration to be applied to
                  nodes in the NodePool. The Tuned API is defined here:

                  https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator/blob/2c76314fb3cc8f12aef4a0dcd67ddc3677d5b54f/pkg/apis/tuned/v1/tuned_types.go

                  The PerformanceProfile API is defined here:
                  https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator/tree/b41042d42d4ba5bb2e99960248cf1d6ae4935018/pkg/apis/performanceprofile/v2

                  Each ConfigMap must have a single key named "tuning" whose value is the
                  JSON or YAML of a serialized Tuned or PerformanceProfile.
