prompt: |
  Should HyperShift invest in building native GPU time-sharing and
  multi-instance GPU (MIG) support directly into the NodePool API,
  or should we rely on the existing partner ecosystem (NVIDIA GPU
  Operator, Intel Device Plugins) and focus our engineering effort
  elsewhere? Consider this from a Red Hat product strategy perspective.
