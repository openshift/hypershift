# Code quality, formatting and conventions

- Use `make lint-fix` after writing Go code to automatically fix most linting issues
- Run `make verify` to verify both linting and tests pass before committing
- For markdown files, use `make verify-codespell` to catch spelling errors
- Always use "When ... it should ..." format for describing test cases when creating unit tests
- Always include unit tests when creating new functions or modifying existing ones
