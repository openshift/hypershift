# HyperShift Enhancement Proposals

A HyperShift Enhancement Proposal is a way to propose, communicate, and coordinate on new efforts for the HyperShift project.

This process is evolving and is not currently mandatory, but is strongly encouraged.

## Quick start

1. Socialize an idea with others.  Make sure others think the work is worth doing, and are willing to review design and code changes required.
2. Follow the process outlined in the [enhancement template](enhancement_template.md).

## FAQs

### Do I have to use the process?

If the enhancement has broad scope, yes.  It helps everyone track why, when, how, and by whom work is done.

### Why would I want to use the process?

Provide a mechanism to communicate design and implementation strategies across the HyperShift community.

### Do I put design in a particular directory?

If it has broad impact, place it in the root of [the `enhancements` directory](../enhancements).  If it's localized to a particular domain, find the appropriate subdirectory.

### My FAQ isn't answered here

Open an issue and ask or even better open a PR with a question and proposed answer.
