# CSRRenewalRoleBindingTemplate instructs the csrapprover controller to
# automatically approve all CSRs made by nodes to renew their client
# certificates.
#
# This binding should be altered in the future to hold a list of node
# names instead of targeting `system:nodes` so we can revoke invidivual
# node's ability to renew its certs.
