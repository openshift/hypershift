# Development Workflows and Tools

This section contains guides and case studies for effective development workflows when working on HyperShift. These are practical examples of using modern development tools to solve real problems.

## Claude Code Case Studies

This subsection documents successful investigations and development workflows using Claude Code (AI-assisted development). Each case study demonstrates:

- **Effective prompting patterns** for complex investigations
- **Tool usage techniques** (file reading, code navigation, comparison analysis)
- **Systematic debugging approaches** (hypothesis formation, evidence gathering, iterative refinement)
- **Documentation practices** (capturing knowledge, avoiding duplication, cross-referencing)

### Purpose

These case studies serve multiple purposes:

1. **Learning Resource**: Show how to leverage AI-assisted development for complex tasks
2. **Template Library**: Provide reusable prompts and workflows for common scenarios
3. **Best Practices**: Demonstrate effective collaboration patterns between developers and AI
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Capture investigation techniques that can be applied to future problems

### Contributing Case Studies

When you have a successful Claude Code investigation or development session:

1. Document the prompting patterns you used
2. Highlight what worked well and what could improve
3. Extract reusable workflows or prompts
4. Show the outcome (code changes, documentation, insights gained)
5. Add it to this directory with a descriptive filename

### Available Case Studies

- [Root Cause Analysis: Test Failure Investigation](claude-code-rca-case-study.md) - Comprehensive example of investigating a false positive test failure, including comparative analysis, code tracing, and documentation updates

**Note**: These guides focus on **how to use development tools effectively**, not on HyperShift-specific implementation details. For HyperShift architecture and troubleshooting methodology, see [AGENTS.md](/AGENTS.md) in the repository root.
