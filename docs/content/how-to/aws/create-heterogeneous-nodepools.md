# Create Heterogeneous NodePools on AWS HostedClusters
## Create Heterogeneous NodePools Through the HyperShift CLI
The `multi-arch` flag was added to the HyperShift CLI in OCP 4.16. The `multi-arch` flag indicates an expectation that the Hosted Cluster will support both amd64 and arm64 NodePools.

When this flag is set, it will ensure:

* if a release image is supplied, the release image must be a multi-arch release image
* if a release stream is supplied, the release stream must be a multi-arch stream


!!! note 

    An individual NodePool only supports one CPU architecture and cannot support multiple CPU archiectures within the same NodePool.


!!! note

    If a multi-arch release image or stream is used and the multi-arch flag is not set, if the management cluster and NodePool CPU arches do not match, the CLI will throw a validation error and not create the Hosted Cluster.
