# HyperShift

HyperShift is middleware for hosting OpenShift control planes at scale that
solves for cost and time to provision, as well as portability cross cloud with
strong separation of concerns between managment and workloads. Clusters are
fully compliant OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) clusters and are compatible
with standard OCP and Kubernetes toolchains.
