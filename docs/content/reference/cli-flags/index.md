# CLI Flag Reference

HyperShift provides two command-line interfaces for creating hosted clusters:

| CLI | Binary | Use Case |
|-----|--------|----------|
| **hcp** | `bin/hcp` | Supported product CLI for customers |
| **hypershift** | `bin/hypershift` | Internal developer CLI (not supported for customer use) |

The `hypershift` CLI includes additional flags for development, testing, and infrastructure reuse that are not available in `hcp`.
