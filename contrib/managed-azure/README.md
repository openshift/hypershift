# General
This directory contains several developer-focused scripts and instructions related to setting up an AKS management cluster and create a HostedCluster replicating what we do in ARO environments.

If you do have issues with these scripts or need further help. Please reach out to #project-hypershift on Red Hat Slack.

Steps:

Create a ServicePrincipal to let hypershift cli create the HostedCluster infra for you.

```
SP_DETAILS=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "${PREFIX}-sp" --role Contributor --scopes "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" -o json)
CLIENT_ID=$(echo "$SP_DETAILS" | jq -r '.appId')
CLIENT_SECRET=$(echo "$SP_DETAILS" | jq -r '.password')

cat <<EOF > ./azure-creds.json
{
   "subscriptionId": "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID",
   "tenantId": "$TENANT_ID",
   "clientId": "$CLIENT_ID",
   "clientSecret": "$CLIENT_SECRET"
}
# EOF
```

!!! warning

    In order for your Hypershift cluster to be created properly, the Microsoft Graph `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy`
    permission must be added to your Service Principal and it also must be assigned to User Access Administrator at the
    subscription level.

    In most cases, you'll need to submit a DPTP request to have this done.

From this repo root folder:

```
mkdir dev
cd dev
```

Create your user-vars.sh file. E.g.

```
cat <<EOF > user-vars.sh
# User variables.
export PREFIX="USER-management"
export PULL_SECRET="/path/pull-secret.txt"
export HYPERSHIFT_BINARY_PATH="/path/go/src/github.com/openshift/hypershift/bin/"
export HYPERSHIFT_IMAGE="quay.io/hypershift/hypershift-operator:latest"
export RELEASE_IMAGE="quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release:4.20.0-ec.3-multi"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export AZURE_CREDS="/path/azure-hypershift-dev.json"
# Azure storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and may contain numbers and lowercase letters only.
export OIDC_ISSUER_NAME="USERmanagement"
EOF
```

Run it

```
../contrib/managed-azure/setup_all.sh
```

### First-time Setup

When setting up your first cluster, use the `--first-time` flag to create the one-time setup resources that should be reused across multiple clusters to avoid Azure quota issues:

```
../contrib/managed-azure/setup_all.sh --first-time
```

The `--first-time` flag automatically handles the creation of:
- Service principals and Key Vault ([setup_MIv3_kv.sh](./setup_MIv3_kv.sh))
- OIDC issuer ([setup_oidc_provider.sh](./setup_oidc_provider.sh))
- Data plane identities ([setup_dataplane_identities.sh](./setup_dataplane_identities.sh))

For subsequent clusters, run the script without this flag to skip the one-time setup and reuse existing resources.

You can comment out steps from setup_all.sh to run only what you want.

## Microsoft Velero Extension

We already include the managed identity/service principal related with Velero, so you just need to execute these commands:

```
../contrib/managed-azure/setup_backup_extension.sh --setup-backup-requirements --deploy-backup-extension
```

or in separate steps:

```
../contrib/managed-azure/setup_backup_extension.sh --setup-backup-requirements
../contrib/managed-azure/setup_backup_extension.sh --deploy-backup-extension
```

## Cleanup and Deletion

When you're done with your clusters, you can use the provided deletion scripts to clean up all resources:

### Complete Cleanup (Recommended)

To delete both the hosted cluster and AKS management cluster along with all associated resources:

```
../contrib/managed-azure/delete_all.sh
```

This script will:
1. Delete the hosted cluster and its managed resources
2. Delete the AKS management cluster and resource group
3. Clean up customer VNET and NSG resource groups
4. Remove AKS-specific Key Vault role assignments
5. Preserve managed identities, service principals, and Key Vault for reuse

### Individual Cleanup Scripts

If you need more granular control, you can run the individual deletion scripts:

#### Delete Only the Hosted Cluster

```
../contrib/managed-azure/delete_hosted_cluster.sh
```

This deletes:
- The hosted cluster itself
- Managed resource group (contains cluster resources)
- Customer VNET resource group
- Customer NSG resource group

#### Delete Only the AKS Management Cluster

```
../contrib/managed-azure/delete_aks_cluster.sh
```

This deletes:
- The AKS management cluster
- AKS resource group
- AKS-specific Key Vault role assignments

Note: Managed identities and Key Vault resources are preserved for reuse across multiple clusters

### Important Notes

- **Safety**: The `delete_all.sh` script includes a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions
- **Order**: When using individual scripts, delete the hosted cluster first, then the AKS cluster
- **Background Operations**: Some resource deletions run in the background and may take several minutes to complete
- **Monitoring**: You can monitor deletion progress with: `az group list --query "[?starts_with(name, 'YOUR-PREFIX')]"`
